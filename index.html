                    Built a web-based application for the Republic of the Marshall Islands Public School System (RMIPSS System) to streamline and digitize the
                    Individualized Education Program (IEP) process, eliminating manual paperwork and improving accessibility for educators. Implemented a bilingual
                    translation feature, allowing seamless switching between English and Marshallese on all web forms. Integrated real-time form validation to
                    enhance data accuracy and prevent errors during data entry. Incorporated secure authentication and authorization using .NET Identity, ensuring
                    role-based access control for different user levels. Added automated email notifications via SMTP2go API to keep administrators and educators
                    informed about critical updates. Designed and delivered a user-friendly interface using ASP.NET MVC and Bootstrap, ensuring ease of use and
                    accessibility. Deployed the system using Docker and Docker Compose on Oracle Cloud VM, enabling scalability and efficient resource management.

                    Developed a machine learning-based University Recommendation System to assist international students in selecting suitable US universities for
                    graduate programs. Leveraged a Kaggle dataset containing over 53,000 entries and implemented data preprocessing techniques to ensure data consistency
                    and accuracy. Utilized supervised machine learning models, including Logistic Regression Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM),
                    K Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Naive Bayes to predict admission chances. The Decision Tree model achieved the highest precision (64%),
                    identifying high-ranked universities, while Naive Bayes demonstrated high recall (89.53%) for universities with high admission certainty.
